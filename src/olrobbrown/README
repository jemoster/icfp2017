Quick and dirty random-ish walk bot.

Made by:
  Michael Yenik, but...

Based on code by Joe Moster. We are in another team together but I made a
separate team to submit to the lightning round due to unavailability of the
registration ID for the original team, and lightning round time constraints.
Everyone who knows the original team ID is asleep and the lightning round is due
soon :(

Ol' Rob starts at a random mine and makes a walk (takes first available adjacent
move) as far as he can go. Upon having no options left, he backtraces his path
looking for a way to continue it. If he traces all the way back to the mine and
there are no options left, he picks another random mine. WIth no mines and no
moves, he chooses randomly.

Does decently against eager bot on larger maps.

Uses only python standard libraries, just needs python 2.
