# Map Viewer

This is a fork of http://punter.inf.ed.ac.uk/graph-viewer/.

To use, from the parent directory (not this one!), run:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Then browse to http://localhost:8000/viewer/.

The viewer needs access to the maps directory, hence running the server from
the parent directory.
